#100 Day of JS

# Day 1: Eloquent JS Chapter 3
**Today's Progress**: Finish reading and doing 3 exercises for chapter 3 of the book. 
**Link to work** : [EloquenJS Chapter3](https://github.com/nnh242/Reading-Notes/tree/master/eloquentJSnotes/chapter-03)
**Thoughts**: This is an attempt to commit to finishing the book. I have never made past chapter 3. I am glad I made past it today. I am committed to use it and learn JS fundamentals. I am committed to building more projects and doing more exercises from this book. Whatever happens, I will complete this book or the 100 day of code challenge this time, whatever comes first.
