# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Fixed task form component for team sight app, labels, placeholder, CSS for better UX.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with making the form close after submission, should I do this in actions or in the local state and trigger an on Click attribute on the add button? I tried both but did not work, not sure what I am missing, maybe I am just too tired for now, but, overall, I feel like I am making progress to perfect this form.

### Day 1:
**Today's Progress**: I decided to make my portfolio more recognizable by picking blue grey background and an light orange highlights. I did not finish this facelift to my website because picking colors took more than an hour. I made a website customized for a job application. Hoping to get it done tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: very down because I want my portfolio to stand out. I watched the analytics on my page, it was very disappointing. I'm determined to make it look more interactive. Plan for tomorrow: create gif and images carousel of my projects.

### Day 2:
**Today's Progress**: I continued to experiment with new colors for my portfolio, going in the blue and green direction, avoiding red and oranges which mean error in a website. I am determined to finish the vue.js site to add to my job application. I really want this front end developer job.

**Thoughts**: had so much fun with colors, although don't know why i can't still can't loop colors with css color_change animation, the colors still seem to be inherited from parents

### Day 3:
**Today's Progress**: Learned how to write a dumb Vue.js component - I love Vue a bit more than React now - because everything is in a single file for a single page app. I also learned to blink colors for texts and icons for my simple introduction page for my job application at AAAS. Really hoping I will get more interviews.

**Thoughts**: Positive :) Happy Thoughts today - Learning makes me happy even small things - still make me happy at 2 AM.

### Day 4:
**Today's Progress**: Cleaning up a messy repo, review open pull request, resolve merge conflicts, learned to reset the refs heads and why I should not do confuse it with delete... further messed up the repo but not defeated. will fix tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: confused about my own repo - must have been when i merge the client and server into 1 repo...

### Day 5:
**Today's Progress**: reorganized portfolio page; style: buttons and elements, add: accents colors, fix: image, bug found on API app.

**Thoughts/ Mood**: tired and waiting to hear back from job applications. i am looking for junior JavaScript developer job.

**Link to Work**: [Portfolio](https://nnh242.github.io/tina.n.hoang/)

### Day 6:
**Today's Progress**: get setup with http-server, Grunt, and Phaser to build a dog runner HTML5 2D game. Game idea: a dog finding its way back home jumping obstacles and eating flying bacon strips, inspired by the folk story of the Korean Jindo.

**Thoughts**: distraction needed, also needed something to show front end skills - HTML5 game it is - Phaser takes a bit of reading to set up plus learning Grunt task runner takes a bit practice. Happy with my game idea. Making the graphic in sketch.

### Day 7:
**Today's Progress**: after a break (super bowl Sunday) - i'm back to getting my portfolio in a better shape. Used fullstory to watch user's experience, they don't click on my projects, I turned my image into gif that demo my projects so now users have to look at my projects the way I want them to look at it.

**Thoughts**: happy that I figured out how to make gif and effectively add more staged interactions with my Portfolio

**Link to Work**: [Portfolio](https://nnh242.github.io/tina.n.hoang/)

### Day 8:
**Today's Progress**: I learned something new today: to use svg - and path and drawing triangles with this.

**Thoughts**: having fun. I am drawing a triangle's dream of multiplying triangles. Figuring out the coordinates is interesting, which makes me think of another way to loop this or map this drawing.

**Link to Work**: [triangle dream](https://codepen.io/nhoang/pen/yvaQwV)

### Day 9:
**Today's Progress**: need to get the streak more consistent and stop missing one day here and there. Today I spent some time with font-pairing, font-sizing, and fixed my Portfolio page.

**Thoughts**: very intrigued by fonts and their design values to emphasize or de-emphasize different elements on a single page. Debating about gif usage if the gif is too slow or too long.

**Link to Work**: [Portfolio](https://nnh242.github.io/tina.n.hoang/)

### Day 10:
**Today's Progress**: drawing triangle - drafted a drawing plan on paper and happy with it, separate them into rows and set a goal to do this in a week. yay!

**Thoughts**: happy :) happy thoughts :) I will draw more.

**Link to Work**: [Triangle Dream](https://nnh242.github.io/a-triangle-dream/)

### Day 11:
**Today's Progress**: fixed button, chart, styling and form issues on react projects

**Thoughts**: happy :) happy thoughts :) went to code and coffee coworking meetup and got help pretty quickly on my form

**Link to Work**: [Team Sight](https://team-sight.herokuapp.com)

### Day 12:

**Today's Progress**: Drawing triangles dreaming about other triangles - svg, css. I mainly learn svg path m l z and other attributes so I can get better at learning d3..which needs to be faster. I really like data visualization and would like to use data to draw pictures

**Thoughts**: feeling slow and unsuccessful Today

### Day 13:

**Today's Progress**: Continue drawing triangles.. there has gotta be a faster way to figure out the coordinates for these triangles. They share at least one side, so why am I drawing two sides and use Z to close it meaning i'm drawing all three sides. I should read more on this.

**Thoughts**: I am staying with this drawing this week to finish all 8 rows. I want to keep this challenge simple to focus on job searching and bug fixing my personal projects.

**Link to Work**: [Triangle Dream](https://nnh242.github.io/a-triangle-dream/)

### Day 14:

**Today's Progress**: - drew more triangles, fixed task form for React App, finding more interview questions online to fork, now it closes by itself after submitting, I want to make the logo more useful but not sure how to at the moment... will research some use case, usually logo redirects to homepage.

**Thoughts**: I want to be able to have intense development while I am still in the coding boot-camp churning out mini projects and projects in days or weeks span...

### Day 15:

**Today's Progress**: fix: bug on React App, opened pull requests - will attempt to resolve merge conflicts - must return to pushing code back to master not the deploy branch. Side goal is to revisit and write down the concepts in Eloquent JavaScript book, and the exercises answers as well.

**Thoughts**: The last 15-ish days have shown me that jumping around new things were not as productive as staying focused on what I know, and re-reading the same materials with more experience. This same book Eloquent JavaScript I read 6 months ago will read differently now. I will start documenting my learning and write reading notes and answers to the coding questions down this time.

**Link to Work**: [messy merge conflicts - 30+ commits ahead of master](https://github.com/nnh242/Team-Sight-App-with-API/pulls)

### Day 16:
**Today's Progress**: drawing more triangles --- practiced interview questions - brushed up on Eloquent JS chapter 3 - functions. :( homesick. Today is Lunar New Year's Eve. In Vietnam it is already New Year Day. #YearOfTheDog

### Day 17:
**Today's Progress**:
- Phaser shooter game
- Learned about branding
- Read chapter 4 Eloquent JS
 bonus: http://tinatheace.site/  was made - yeah I aced stuffs - learned how to publish a gh-pages to custom domain using namecheap; this helped me: https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx?type=article&contentid=9645&categoryid=2208&rating=5 â€¦

**Thoughts**: happy that I learned branding from Robbie the Geek. Now I am Tina the Ace because I ace stuffs and I also play poker when I'm not coding or cooking.

**Link to Work**: (http://tinatheace.site)

### Day 18:
**Today's Progress**: realized that the frame is way off after adding the outline, it is easier to draw this out with x and y axis and figure out which to move to (M) in the d of the <path> who knows drawing with svg brings back algebra 1 memory.

**Thoughts**: I really like drawing with <svg>; it's like drawing on x and y axis. I can set the scale in the svg tag, and then move to the path and set the length where to go from there. I am exploring path, line, curves and their combination and mutation to draw something abstract like the triangles or something familiar like the shape of a chair or a clock.

**Link to Work**: [Triangle Dream](https://nnh242.github.io/a-triangle-dream/)
### Day 19:
**Today's Progress**: learning LESS using Tutorials and WinLess online examples.
**Thoughts**: I like this because it is similar to the way I think in JavaScript. I have been finding a way to call headline a variable and define all the font family, size and color for it and reuse it in other class. Now I know to use mixins and variable to do that. I really like this because it is the way I think about styling and finally learned a tool/a way to do it.

### Day 20:
**Today's Progress**:
I am pushing through some frustrating reading materials today. I want to learn clean code the struggle between clean vs predictable is real. Reading = Hiking for me. Hard to start and harder to stop.
**Thoughts**: I like JavaScript - I have not found a way to enjoy Algorithm yet. Reading through the Eloquent JavaScript version 3 updates and the algorithm questions on thatJSdude are very draining. I am taking my time slowly with this.

**Link to Work**: [Reading notes](https://github.com/nnh242/Reading-Notes)

### Day 21:
**Today's Progress**:
 I circled back to the Phaser tutorial on how to build a space ship game and found a polished tutorial to learn from. I am using this as a sandbox to test the movements and game play for my dog infinite runner game.

 **Thoughts**: This game is so much fun to build. I follow step by step the tutorial that was built before me and then I am taking notes with comments and plan some feature for my other game of infinite runner. Decided that the background provides continuous scrolling to create "the run" like in Mario, and the movement of hero character will be very controlled and there are specific methods in Phaser.js that can be used to do this. Squishing the image and acceleration, max speed and drag also will add to the movements and create a feel of running, jumping, crouching for the hero character. Excited to learn more.

### Day 22:

**Today's Progress**:  Half done game and half studied book... very tired but cannot sleep.

**Thoughts**: Dead tired and exhausted from day job. Freaking out about technical interviews and decided to stop studying tonight and continued to build the space ship game... in the middle of the space ship game... I was still freaking out about the technical interview so I came back to studying stuffs on thatJSdude and Eloquent JavaScript. I might as well hold up this book and pray to JavaScript God to be with me tomorrow morning at 11 am EST so I will pass my interview.

**Link to Work**: [Space Ship Game](https://github.com/nnh242/shemup)

### Day 23:

**Today's Progress**:Added more stuffs to this: [space ship game](https://nnh242.github.io/shemup/)   :D also trying the learnyounode package from [nodeschool] (http://nodeschool.io)

### Day 24:
- write doc for current projects, making sure that they are well written and free of errors. (http://tinatheace.site)  
- practice whiteboard interview, write and talk the answers on my own, with the book: cracking the code interview
- explore python

### Day 25:
Sketching up assets for my dog runner Phaser game. #html5 #CSS (beginning) #gamedev. As I move the background of the run, I also want to animate the dog. This is a good reference for animation:[Fluffy Cocopuffy ref](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qV5pdO_X8U)
**Thoughts**: I will use sketched up assets to do this instead of drawing the hero dog by svg because my goal for this game now is to get the v1 of game play and story working first.

### Day 26 and 27:
Shifting my focus away from building games and more towards prepping for upcoming technical interviews.
Practicing for interview questions online, with mentors and reading more on cracking the coding interview and refactoring JavaScript.

**Thoughts**: I realized that companies are not willing to hire people with little or no experience. I honestly think that this mindset is destructive, your senior developers will leave because they are doing the tasks that junior devs could have done plus they do not get to pass down their crafts. If you're worried about the costs of paying a senior devs to train a junior devs or productivity please think about the cost of them leaving and turnover as well. I am thinking that I should blog about this one day when I get to interview at more companies.

### Day 28:
**Today's Progress**:

- flipped a PC I built in 2008 by installing Linux Mint and boot it along side the Windows
- spent 2 hours booting, installing and playing with software management in Linux Mint :) I am not going back to Windows and gave up on the idea of buying a new iMac. Saved money.
- learned to install sublime, git on linux - very easy. also linux mint cinnamon comes with python already installed! yay!
- studying hash map and how to use it to solve the question:  print first unique character in a string in JavaScript. This was my solution under pressure in a real interview - live coding challenge in 45 minutes:

```
function testString(str){
//  console.log(str);
  let char='';
  for(let i = 0; i<= str.length; i++ ) {
    let char = str[i];
    let next = str[i+1];
//    console.log(char, next);
    if (char == next) {
      //if the character is the same as the next one -- keep going
      char = str[i++];
      next = str[i+2];
    }
    else{
      return char;
    }
  }
}

console.log(testString("AABBCDD"));
console.log(testString("AABBCCDEEFF"));

```

-I found this solution on leetcode - it even returns the position of the character - otherwise return -1.

```
const firstUniqChar = function(s)
    const map=new Map();
    for(let i=0;i<s.length;i++){
         if(map.has(s[i])){
             map.set(s[i],2);
         }
         else{
             map.set(s[i],1);
         }
     }

    for(let i=0;i<s.length;i++){
        if(map.has(s[i]) && map.get(s[i])===1){
            return i;
        }
    }
    return -1;
 } ;
```
### Day 29:
**Today's Progress**: Coding interview questions. Big O notation review.

**Thoughts**: Big O is not hard to understand when given good examples to understand. I am a problem solver and I want to solve it fast, I care about how fast my code can solve a problem and I see that Big O notates that. :) I enjoy reading and want to learn how to make sparknotes for the three programming books that I borrowed/bought.

### Day 30:
**Today's Progress**: Reading continued. I have to prepare for coding interviews. I am not building new projects but continued with learning about refactoring JS and following the book on a specific example on new code from scratch, testing it and refactoring it.

**Thoughts**: Refactoring is not rewriting. It is making the code better in quality (which can be decided by the dev team to be what is the make up the quality of the code) without changing the behavior of the code. This is an important point. Writing code is solving problems. There are many ways to solve a problem and with constraints from resources and time, code quality either suffers or improves depending.

**Link to Work**:

### Day 31:

**Today's Progress**:
Learning python today. I like stuffs that have snakes as symbols since I am born in the year of the snake.


**Thoughts**: Python is interesting and more defined than JavaScript. I feel that Python, Django, Ruby and JavaScript are in the same cluster, I think this way ... very similiar to the Python's syntax. JavaScript hoisting, scopes and closures always baffle me.

**Link to Work**: [Python notes](https://github.com/nnh242/learning-python)

### Day 32:

**Today's Progress**: taking it easy with FreeCodeCamp materials and really go back to the basics. Mainly I am curious what the self-taught folks are using to learn. I first found this site in 2016 but opted to go to a bootcamp for full concentration in HTML, CSS and JS. It also turns out that the bootcamp does not go into the details of syntax like in the freeCodeCamp curriculum which may need updating to ES6.

**Thoughts**: I am super burned out from going to meetups, applying for jobs and holding my day job as an accountant this past week. It takes a lot to always be positive and say great things about myself to attract employers while having 3-4 rejections/week for not having enough experience as a full stack developer or that some positions want 3-5 years of experience while I have 1.

### Day 33:

**Today's Progress**:
- Cracking the coding interviews chapter 2 Big O notation full reading
- Update CV, resume and published it to portfolio website

**Thoughts**: Busy.. too busy.

**Link to Work**: (tinatheace.site)

### Day 34:

**Today's Progress**: Learning the process of the coding interview and working through white boarding questions. Hash table/map is my best friend for the next six months.

### Day 35:

**Today's Progress**: Making progress on installing propietary driver for AMD Radeon Graphic card on my Linux Mint machine. It is fun to learn about a new platform. I am dumping windows and mac iOS for linux :) would not learn how to do install driver on linux had I installed ubuntu, which comes with Radeon driver installed.

**Thoughts**: Although I am not building new code these two days but I am learning how to use basic scripting to get linux up and running on a very old computer I built in 2008. My graphic card was very expensive for me back then, which lasted until now. 10 years now. White boarding questions are not scary now that I am learning a method to solve it and optimize it. I have not finished reading fully about BUD optimization or other ways to optimize a solution to general (use any language) technical question. I want to be able to use more examples to solve the problems.

### Day 36:

**Today's Progress**: struggling with basic scripting to fix linux mint black screen issue, to install graphic card driver and now this: linux mint is stuck on start up with 4 green dots... at least it is not a black screen...

### Day 37:
**Today's Progress**: finished documentation on my MERN app :) yay!

**Thoughts**: having fun at Code and Coffee in DC

**Link to Work**: (Team Sight Doc)[https://github.com/nnh242/Team-Sight-App-with-API/blob/deploy-branch/README.md]

### Day 38:
**Today's Progress**: trying to get a focus on learning and filtering through the noise. I have chose my three activities to focus on for the next 30 days: 1. learn/solidify my skills on treehouse 2.contribute to open source project 3. apply/interview for jobs with the help of cracking the coding interview book + pramp +thinkful mock interviews mentors. My ultimate goal is to get a remote full stack developer job.

**Thoughts**: focus is key and sleep is for the weak.
### Day 39:
**Today's Progress**: found a way to contribute to 1 open source project even though it meant only to add my name to the contributor list. It is also great to meet new people trying to get into coding and getting that first developer job. It is another stretch to reach what I want.

**Link to Work**: https://github.com/Roshanjossey/first-contributions/pull/3384

### Day 40:
**Today's Progress**: back to the books.
**Thoughts**: After trying out pluralsight, treehouse, coursera, and watch and code, I will stick with coursera because of the structure and the cost. I do better in materials where I can pace myself instead of the spoon-feeding or bite-size lessons. I also don't mind reading now because some books are representation of the author, it is like I am talking to a developer about JS. At some point, reading really opens up the brain to piece things together in a different way.
**Link to work**: [Reading Notes](https://github.com/nnh242/Reading-Notes)

### Day 41:
**Today's Progress**: more reading and update on personal website
**Thoughts**: recursive functions are leaps of faith.
**Link to work**: (www.tinatheace.site)

### Day 42:
**Today's Progress**: not really any progress, got an interview today in person. Learned about JS obfuscator -- it tickles my brain. Encoding and decoding are a sort of translation, with specific rules and parameters. A function can automate and save time. When there's no progress or nothing to be code ... I draw triangles in SVG. Just triangles on top of new triangles... to remind myself to make a better and higher version of myself. Just the same triangle but in a different angle, a different position, but always better than yesterday.
**Thoughts** : burning out is easy when I try to keep up with things. Priorities are family and my health.

### Day 43:
**Today's Progress**: fix: the style of portfolio. learn: more on JS basics. I will solidify my knowledge to change my approach to code. I tend to think longer and longer before writing code now. I have an idea to make things work but I also want to work it nicely.
**Link to work**: (www.tinatheace.site)

### Day 44:
**Today's Progress**: re-arrange elements on my portfolio website, as I am learning more about UI, putting emphasis on project's name and add icons to represent the technologies instead of using text.
**Thoughts**: I am more creative when I don't have stress. Perhaps my portfolio will look more visual now with very few texts and more icons for the names of the technologies that I used and I am working with. I want to learn how to include data visualization and illustration. I have new plans to add to my portfolio: a list of games built with Phaser and a project using D3 - data intensive and rich visualization, maybe hooking a public API in and do a case study on real estate.
**Link to work**: (www.tinatheace.site)

### Day 45:
**Today's Progress**: edited ReadME.md for CBJournal.
**Thoughts**: thinking to redo the UI and UX for this CB Journal. API definitely has a limitation in terms of number of job posts, it is too bad the Dice API got taken down in October of 2017, they had more params to mine data from, I was going to do a map API as well to show who is hiring in a map. Google API is next. This CB Journal is definitely useful and worth the time to flesh out. Getting a Node Server hooked up to this will allow full CRUD operation on the app instead of simple AJAX Get call to the external Github Jobs API. There are a lot to do for this app to flesh it out and bring it up to the level of other projects in my portfolio.
