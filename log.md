# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Fixed task form component for team sight app, labels, placeholder, CSS for better UX.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with making the form close after submission, should I do this in actions or in the local state and trigger an on Click attribute on the add button? I tried both but did not work, not sure what I am missing, maybe I am just too tired for now, but, overall, I feel like I am making progress to perfect this form.

### Day 1:
**Today's Progress**: I decided to make my portfolio more recognizable by picking blue grey background and an light orange highlights. I did not finish this facelift to my website because picking colors took more than an hour. I made a website customized for a job application. Hoping to get it done tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: very down because I want my portfolio to stand out. I watched the analytics on my page, it was very disappointing. I'm determined to make it look more interactive. Plan for tomorrow: create gif and images carousel of my projects.

### Day 2:
**Today's Progress**: I continued to experiment with new colors for my portfolio, going in the blue and green direction, avoiding red and oranges which mean error in a website. I am determined to finish the vue.js site to add to my job application. I really want this front end developer job.

**Thoughts**: had so much fun with colors, although don't know why i can't still can't loop colors with css color_change animation, the colors still seem to be inherited from parents

### Day 3:
**Today's Progress**: Learned how to write a dumb Vue.js component - I love Vue a bit more than React now - because everything is in a single file for a single page app. I also learned to blink colors for texts and icons for my simple introduction page for my job application at AAAS. Really hoping I will get more interviews.

**Thoughts**: Positive :) Happy Thoughts today - Learning makes me happy even small things - still make me happy at 2 AM.

### Day 4:
**Today's Progress**: Cleaning up a messy repo, review open pull request, resolve merge conflicts, learned to reset the refs heads and why I should not do confuse it with delete... further messed up the repo but not defeated. will fix tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: confused about my own repo - must have been when i merge the client and server into 1 repo...

### Day 6:
**Today's Progress**: get setup with http-server, Grunt, and Phaser to build a dog runner HTML5 2D game. Game idea: a dog finding its way back home jumping obstacles and eating flying bacon strips, inspired by the folk story of the Korean Jindo.
**Thoughts**: distraction needed, also needed something to show front end skills - HTML5 game it is - Phaser takes a bit of reading to set up plus learning Grunt task runner takes a bit practice. Happy with my game idea. Making the graphic in sketch.

### Day 7:
**Today's Progress**: after a break (super bowl Sunday) - i'm back to getting my portflio in a better shape. Used fullstory to watch user's experience, they don't click on my projects, I turned my image into gif that demo my projects so now users have to look at my projects the way I want them to look at it.

**Thoughts**: happy that I figured out how to make gif and effectively add more staged interactions with my Portfolio
