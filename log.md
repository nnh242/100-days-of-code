# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Fixed task form component for team sight app, labels, placeholder, CSS for better UX.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with making the form close after submission, should I do this in actions or in the local state and trigger an on Click attribute on the add button? I tried both but did not work, not sure what I am missing, maybe I am just too tired for now, but, overall, I feel like I am making progress to perfect this form.

### Day 1:
**Today's Progress**: I decided to make my portfolio more recognizable by picking blue grey background and an light orange highlights. I did not finish this facelift to my website because picking colors took more than an hour. I made a website customized for a job application. Hoping to get it done tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: very down because I want my portfolio to stand out. I watched the analytics on my page, it was very disappointing. I'm determined to make it look more interactive. Plan for tomorrow: create gif and images carousel of my projects.

### Day 3:
**Today's Progress**: Learned how to write a dumb Vue.js component - I love Vue a bit more than React now - because everything is in a single file for a single page app. I also learned to blink colors for texts and icons for my simple introduction page for my job application at AAAS. Really hoping I will get interviews.

**Thoughts**: Positive :) Happy Thoughts today - Learning makes me happy even small things - still make me happy at 2 AM.

### Day 2:
**Today's Progress**: I continued to experiment with new colors for my portfolio, going in the blue and green direction, avoiding red and oranges which mean error in a website. I am determined to finish the vue.js site to add to my job application. I really want this front end developer job.

**Thoughts**: had so much fun with colors, although don't know why i can't still can't loop colors with css color_change animation, the colors still seem to be inherited from parents
